          <span>
            <p>
              Right away from his childhood,Dallington ever wanted to be a resourceful scientist and he drew this from the inspirational works
              of the several world great scientists like Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Neils Bohr and Galileo Galilei.
              Even up to date, he feels his dream is still alive given the fact that he is in a field of engineering, a field that
              he grew as a field of dream.What drives him is his passion
              to influence the community through designing and implementing innovative technologies.
            </p>

            <p>Dallington's first sale of his one of software systems was <span class="text-primary">$492</span> and this drastically boosted his confidence to visualize the magic of empowering and impressing upon the mind, the right input.<br><span class="text-info">Mark Zuckerburg</span> graduation speech at <a href="http://www.havard.com">Havard University</a>, 2017 inspired Dallington to understand the need for every human life to have a sense of purpose rather than progress and so he has that degree of desire, willingness and enthusiasm to have a positive impact on many human lives in this world. <br><span id="Education"></span>

              <p>
                Dallington looks forward to establishing a Tech company that will engage many young Ugandans to attain skills and knowledge whose use will hinge on changing the world through technology to be a better place to live for every human life.
