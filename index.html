            <h5 class="title">Introduction</h5>
            <p>
            I am a professional software engineer and computer science instructor with over five years of experience. I am the founder of <a href="https://agrixapp.com" class="text-info" target="_blank">AgriX</a>, a platform that empowers farmers in remote areas of Uganda to access profitable markets for their agricultural produce, purchase inputs, and gain access to vital farming information and weather insights. I co-founded <a href="https://pivosoft.com" class="text-info" target="_blank">Pivosoft</a>, a startup digitizing small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). Additionally, I established <a href="https://academy.pivosoft.com" class="text-info" target="_blank">Pivosoft Coding Academy</a>, offering young people with free mentorship in software development and training.
            I graduated with First Class Honors as the top student in my cohort with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. Previously, I volunteered as a visiting lecturer at Makerere University with the support of my former professors. Currently, I am a lecturer at the International Business, Science, and Technology University.
        </p>

            <p>
                My commitment is to harness technology to tackle societal challenges. Notably, I have built software applications for small, medium-sized businesses in Kampala, such as Kimote Maize Factory, Kakongoriro Stores, and Collection Hub, and non-governmental organisations notably <a href="https://www.experienceeducate.org" class="text-dark font-weight-bolder">Educate!</a>. Additionally, I have collaborated with Vastel Health, a private health company, and designed Vastel, a mobile application that enables patients seek medical services through virtual consultations with medical professionals.

                        <p>
                            Leading a university discussion group on software engineering deepened my understanding of the field’s principles and sparked my interest in applying technology to solve real-world challenges. In 2018, while exploring the potential of software across industries, I discovered a paper from the International Journal of Public Administration and Management Research (Vol. 3, No. 2, December 2015). It highlighted a critical issue faced by SMEs in Uganda: inadequate technology limiting their access to finance and markets. This technological gap hindered efficiency, increased costs, and restricted growth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Motivated to address these challenges, I conceptualised an idea to digitise and modernise SME operations. In 2019, I persuaded two colleagues to join me, and we co-founded Pivosoft, a startup that empowers SMEs through tailored digital solutions. I oversaw the development of systems that enhanced operational efficiency, streamlined processes, and improved customer engagement. SMEs across retail, agriculture, and healthcare sectors have adopted our solutions, reporting a reduction in operational costs and an increase in customer retention. By empowering businesses with digital tools, we have enabled them to transition from traditional methods to modern, technology-driven processes, ensuring their competitiveness in the marketplace.

                Dallington graduated with <span class="text-info">honors</span> and as the best student in Bachelor of
                Science in Software Engineering in May 2021 from Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda.
                The Government of Uganda funded his undergraduate education after he emerged as one of the country's top
                students in the national high school examinations in 2016.
            </p>

            <p>
                Prior to enrolling in the university, Dallington completed his Advanced Certificate of Education (UACE)
                at St. John's S.S. Nyabwina, where he was also granted a scholarship. He majored in PCM/ICT (Physics,
                Chemistry, Mathematics, and Computer Studies) and obtained <span class="text-info">18</span> out of
                <span class="text-info">20</span> possible points, with an A in Mathematics, Bs in Physics and
                Chemistry, and 2 points for the auxiliary disciplines (General paper and computer studies).
                <br><i class="text-info fw-bold">Achievement</i>:<i> Emerged as the best student in the school, the entire district, and ranked among the top students in the country.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                From 2010 to 2013, Dallington attended Bugarama High School for Ordinary Level Education on a full
                scholarship, where he earned <span class="text-info">14</span> aggregates out of <span class="text-info">8</span> and was the top student in terms of overall school O-level achievement.
                <br><i class="text-info fw-bold">Achievement</i>:<i> Emerged as the best student in the school, the second best in the entire district, and among the top students in the country.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                At Rweibaare Primary School, where he spent eight years, Dallington Asingwire began his academic career.
                He received an overall score of <span class="text-info">7</span> out of <span class="text-info">4</span>, with a D1 in mathematics and D2s in science, English, and social
                studies. He was the best student and received a Primary Leaving Examination (PLE) Certificate.
                <br><i class="text-info fw-bold">Achievement</i>:<i> Emerged as the best student in the school and among the best students in the country.</i>
